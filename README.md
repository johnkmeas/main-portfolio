# This is a Responsive Single page 

I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS/SASS and jQuery. The majority of the content being displayed is dynamically outputted to the DOM using jQuery. It's a good way to stay organized and not have to repeat myself with writing out the html for every item. I've also used jQuery to add animation to the menu icons and also determine which images get loaded based on the size of the browser window. I'm sure with more experience, I will find ways improve my implementation of jQuery.
