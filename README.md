## This is my Single Page Site

I've built this site with HTML, CSS and jQuery. I've created all the illustrations using Photoshop and Illustrator.

##Where jQuery is Used

* Inserts data into html elements and then appends to the DOM
* Create smooth scrolling effect between sections when a link in the navigation is trigger
* Triggers animation event menu when it's clicked
* Detects browser screen width and determines the image source based on the width


##SASS and Flexbox
I started using SASS recently to separate and organize my css files with partials. I love using colour variables and it has made working with css a joy.

The main hero image is a work table that represents my balance of creativity and hardwork that drives my passion for web technologies.
