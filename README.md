## This is my Single Page Site

I've built this site with HTML, CSS and jQuery. I've created all the illustrations using Photoshop and Illustrator.

* Detects browser screen width and determines the image source based on the width

I've made some illustrations and arranged it to look like a work table that represents my balance of creativity and hardwork that drives my passion for web technologies.
